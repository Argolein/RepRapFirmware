These patches contain a few modified Arduino source code files to achieve the following with the Duet firmware:

- Utilisation of the internal watchdog (saftey-critical for machines with heaters)
- Increased RX buffers for low-level networking
- Implementation of Stream::canWrite to send data via UART or USB only if the buffers can accept data

You need to use Arduino 1.5.8 to use these patches. They may work with older releases, but this has not been tested.

If you want to merge these patches into another Arduino toolkit, search the files for "dc42" to see which lines changed.
