RepRap Machine SD card setup

To set up the RepRap macine's SD card copy the contents of the appropriate folder in the setup folder to the sys folder.  Thus if you have a Huxley Duo with a dual head, from this folder:

  $ cp setup/hux-2-hd/* sys

The folders under setup are:

  Huxley Duo with 1 head -   hux-1-hd
  Huxley Duo with 2 heads -  hux-2-hd
  Ormerod 2 with 1 head -    orm-1-hd
  Ormerod 2 with 2 heads -   orm-2-hd

Then drag and drop the folders gcodes, sys and www to the machine's SD card.
