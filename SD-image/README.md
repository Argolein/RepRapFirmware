This directory contains multiple sys directories for each Ormerod printer configuration.

You MUST copy the right "sys-<configuration>" directory to your SD card, rename it to "sys" and then create a copy of /sys/default.g called "config.g" if it doesn't already exist.
You can then customise your machine parameters in that new config.g file.

Also don't forget to update your /web directory with my latest Ormerod web interface from https://github.com/zombiepantslol/DuetWebControl (use "Download ZIP" on the right side).
