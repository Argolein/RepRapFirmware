This directory contains multiple SD card images for each Ormerod printer configuration.

You MUST copy the contents of the right directory to your SD card and you MUST create a copy of /sys/default.g called config.g in the same directory if it doesn't already exist.
You can then customise your machine parameters in that new config.g file.

Also don't forget to update your /web directory with my latest Ormerod web interface from https://github.com/zombiepantslol/OrmerodWebControl.
