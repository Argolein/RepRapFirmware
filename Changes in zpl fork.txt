Additional features in comparison to dc42's and/or RRP's official firmware:

* Cooling support: M106 can invert PWM cooling if "I1" is passed to it once (required for a 4-pin PWM fan)

* Interrupt-driven ethernet input to increase reliability

* FTP server support with long file lists (up to 20KB)

* Telnet support

* Config output: M503 removes duplicate whitespaces to display the new RRP config template completely

* Cold extrudes: M302 can allow or deny them with the "P" parameter, it reports the status if no arguments are specified

* Discrimination between cold extrudes and cold retracts for filament changing (minimum retraction temperature is 90Â°C)

* Z-probing: M558 can be used to specify the axes for which the Z probe will be used (e.g. M558 P1 X0 Y0 Z1 for Z-probing only)

* File information for files being printed are displayed on page reload (except for layer stats)

* Lowered minimum extrusion temperature from 170C to 160C

* Reduced Z-probe height for automatic bed compensation from 8mm to 5mm

* Added interrupt to pin 25 (Duet) / pin 10 (Duex4) on the expansion header for 4-pin PWM tacho line (can be viewed with my web interface fork)

* Firmware binaries are built with -O3 optimization enabled

* Information can be read from both Slic3r and Cura G-code files for the web interface

* Calling G28 and M1 resets homed axes

* M0 does NOT disable any drives. IMHO, M1 is absolutely sufficient for this purpose.

* All non-moving codes are queued to ensure they're executed in-time

* When prints are paused, all the moves will stop as soon as the current move is complete

* Bug fix: Layer height and filament usage for web interface are read from both start and end of a gcode file

* Bug fix: Some extruder moves were not performed properly due to bad acceleration values
