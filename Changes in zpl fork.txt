Additional features in comparison to dc42's and/or RRP's official firmware:

* Cooling support: M106 can invert PWM cooling if "I1" is passed to it once (required for a 4-pin PWM fan)

* Interrupt-driven ethernet input to increase reliability

* FTP server support with long file lists (up to 20KB)

* Telnet support

* Config output: M503 removes duplicate whitespaces to display the new RRP config template completely

* Cold extrudes: M302 can allow or deny them with the "P" parameter, it reports the status if no arguments are specified

* Z-probing: M558 can be used to specify the axes for which the Z probe will be used (e.g. M558 P1 X0 Y0 Z1 for Z-probing only)

* File information for files being printed are displayed on page reload (except for layer stats)

* Bug fix: Layer height for web interface is read from both start and end of a gcode file
