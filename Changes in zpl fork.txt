Additional features in comparison to dc42's and/or RRP's official firmware:

* Cooling support: M106 can invert PWM cooling if "I1" is passed to it once (required for a 4-pin PWM fan)

* Interrupt-driven ethernet input to increase reliability

* FTP server support with long file lists (up to 20KB)

* Telnet support

* Config output: M503 removes duplicate whitespaces to display the new RRP config template completely on the web interface

* Cold extrudes: M302 can allow or deny them with the "P" parameter, it reports the status if no arguments are specified

* Discrimination between cold extrudes and cold retracts for filament changing (minimum retraction temperature is 90Â°C)

* Z-probing: M558 can be used to specify the axes for which the Z probe will be used (e.g. M558 P1 X0 Y0 Z1 for Z-probing only)

* File information for files being printed are displayed on page reload (except for layer stats)

* Lowered minimum extrusion temperature from 170C to 160C

* Reduced Z-probe height for automatic bed compensation from 8mm to 5mm

* Added interrupt to pin 25 (Duet) / pin 10 (Duex4) on the expansion header for 4-pin PWM tacho line (can be viewed with my web interface fork)

* Firmware binaries are built with -O3 optimization enabled

* File information can be retrieved from G-Code files generated by common slicers (Slic3r, Cura and S3D)

* Calling G28 and M1 resets homed axes

* M0 does NOT turn off any drives, however M1 still does. Use my web interface fork (version 1.03+) to restart failed prints easily on demand

* Buffered G-codes are enqueued if moves are being performed to ensure all codes are executed just-in-time

* When prints are paused, movement stops as soon as the current move has finished

* default.g is executed if config.g cannot be found (same behaviour as with versions older than 0.90)

* config.g has been removed from the SD-image directory, copy default.g to create it

* dc42's ultrasonic IR probe index has changed from 3 to 4 to stay compatible with RRP's official firmware

* X-axis direction remains compatible with prior releases, meaning all stepper motor connectors on a Duet v0.6 are connected the same way round.
  This was changed once more with RRP's dev FW 0.90 and their official 0.78 FW, however my Ormerod 1 "default.g" file has been updated to compensate this

* Bug fix: Actual extruder positions are reported instead of the internal ones from the GCodes class

* Bug fix: Layer height and filament usage for web interface are read from both start and end of a gcode file
